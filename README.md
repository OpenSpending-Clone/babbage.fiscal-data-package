# Babbage Fiscal Data Package Support

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/openspending/babbage.fiscal-data-package/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/openspending/babbage.fiscal-data-package?branch=master)

This module is intended to provide bi-directional support for conversion
between ``babbage`` internal models and OKFN's Fiscal Data Package.

It also builds upon Babbage's Flask Blueprint to expose the imported data packages via a simple API.
